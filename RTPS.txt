The Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) is a significant enhancement of the classic Spanning Tree Protocol (STP). Its main objective is to eliminate network loops in Ethernet networks by ensuring a single active path exists between any two network devices. Let's explore some of the key features of RSTP:

Enhanced Convergence Speed: RSTP is renowned for its quicker convergence compared to its predecessor STP. This allows it to swiftly adapt to changes in the network topology, thereby reducing downtime.

Updated Port Roles: RSTP introduces new port roles such as Root Port, Designated Port, Alternate Port, and Backup Port. These roles contribute to greater network efficiency and reliability.

Use of BPDUs: To maintain an updated view of the network topology, RSTP utilizes Bridge Protocol Data Units (BPDUs). These messages allow switches to exchange information about the network and react promptly to changes.

Compatibility with STP: One of the advantages of RSTP is its backward compatibility with STP. This means it can be integrated into networks that still utilize devices running the older STP protocol.
